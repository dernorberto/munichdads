There are so many TV shows to please all kinds of kids and parents that it is nowadays possible to make a pick of things that you can your little one watch without being too worried.

I hope to setup a list of things to show (and not show) to our little ones.

## TV Shows
These are the ones I let my 3.5 yo watch:
* Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood - my absolute favorite and recommendation (1)
* Peppa Pig - it's silly but very cute and a classic, in German she's called Peppa Wurz
* Poppy Cat - it's all imaginary, a cat dreaming about the stories her master reads to her
* Baby Jake - not this is absolutely freaky for adults but super, duper, califragilisticexpialidocious for kids, even very young ones
* Puffin Rock - super sweet show about Puffins, a kind of bird

There are a more of course, but this would be my current top 5.

1 - I hold the show in such high regard that I cannot not talk about it. It's based on Mr Rogers Neighborhood, a show that was "competing" with Sesame Street and tried to teach kids good values and how to handle and deal with emotions and situations.

## Movies
Disney movies are tricky because they handle adult themes and use very emotional and sometimes (too) exciting music. We used to watch Frozen, I honestly don't get tired of Let it go, but we stopped.

Recommendations from other parents:
* Paddington Bear (the movie released not that long ago)

## Naughtly list
The stuff I did not like at all.
* Caillou - he's a brat and I don't think I should show my kids how brats are the heroes
