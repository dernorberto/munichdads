## Movies
Disney movies are tricky because they handle adult themes and use very emotional and sometimes (too) exciting music. We used to watch Frozen, I honestly don't get tired of Let it go, but we stopped.

Recommendations from other parents:
* Paddington Bear (the movie released not that long ago)
* Vayana
  * except for the starting scene and the end, it's all smooth sailing and no scares with wonderful music
