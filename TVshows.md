## TV & Kids, Kids & TV...

I am not ashamed to say it, but my kids watch TV although we try to only show nice stuff, here's a list of stuff available at the time of this writing or just generally.

### Gentle

* The Hive - it's about bees, and they even play soccer
* Julie's Green Room - Julie Andrews & Jim Henson, puppets are being coached by Julie
  * we love the fact that one of the puppet characters is in a wheelchair
* Sarah & Duck - very good looking, gentle and imaginative
  * absolutely lovely, there is zero speed or violence
* Poppy Cat - a cat imagines stories that her owner tells her
  * kids get scared sometimes but it's usually from a giant cute robot
* Thomas the Tank Engine - Kind of Educational, lots of lessons and super well animated
* Puffin Rock - super sweet show about Puffins, a kind of bird

### Paedagogical

* Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood - my absolute favorite and recommendation
* Mr Rogers Neighborhood - the precursor to Daniel Tiger

### Funny

* Peppa Pig - a classic
  * I recently discovered that they are not polite at all
* Ben & Holly - from the makers and voices of Peppa Pig
* Pocoyo -  a 4-year-old boy, interacting with his friends Pato (a duck), Elly (an elephant) and Loula (a dog). Funny and available in many languages on youtube.
